The customer receives value over the term of the project based on the amount of work that has been completed towards the delivery of the completed project. Depending on the project, the most reliable measure of progress is either the cost incurred or time elapsed towards delivery of the completed project. Therefore, the input method provides the most reliable method to measure progress. Revenue recognition begins when work has commenced. Costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance, indirect labor, and overhead costs, which are charged to contract costs as incurred. Revisions in estimates during the course of contract work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts requiring the revision become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period a loss on a contract becomes determinable.'},\n",

We initially acquired a controlling interest in the third party in April 2015. Therefore, this transaction was treated as an equity transaction, and the cash payment is reported as part of cash flow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 2, 2018, we sold substantially all of the assets of the Allscripts\\u2019 business providing hospitals and health systems document and other content management software and services generally known as \\u201cOneContent\\u201d to Hyland Software, Inc., an Ohio corporation (\\u201cHyland\\u201d). Allscripts acquired the OneContent business during the fourth quarter of 2017 through the acquisition of the EIS Business (as defined below). Certain assets of Allscripts relating to the OneContent business were excluded from the transaction and retained by Allscripts. In addition, Hyland assumed certain liabilities related to the OneContent business. The total consideration for the OneContent business was $260 million, which was subject to certain adjustments for liabilities assumed by Hyland and net working capital. We realized a pre-tax gain upon sale of $177.9 million which is included in the \\u201cGain on sales of businesses, net\\u201d line in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On March 15, 2018, we contributed certain assets and liabilities of our Strategic Sourcing business unit, acquired as part of the acquisition of the EIS Business in 2017, into a new entity together with $2.7 million of cash as additional consideration. In exchange for our contributions, we obtained a 35.7% interest in the new entity, which was valued at $4.0 million, and is included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of this transaction, we recognized an initial pre-tax loss of $0.9 million and $4.7 million in additional losses due to measurement period adjustments upon the finalization of carve-out balances, mainly related to accounts receivable. These losses are included on the \\u201cGain on sale of businesses, net\\u201d line in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On February 6, 2018, we acquired all of the common stock of a cloud-based analytics software platform provider for a purchase price of $8.0 million in cash. The allocation of the consideration is as follows: $1.1 million of intangible assets related to technology; $0.6 million to customer relationships; $6.6 million of goodwill; $0.8 million to accounts receivable; deferred revenue of $0.6 million and $0.5 million of long-term deferred income tax liabilities. The allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The acquired intangible asset related to technology will be amortized over 8 years using a method that approximates the pattern of economic benefits to be gained from the intangible asset. The customer relationship was amortized over one year. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of this acquisition were not material to our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our other equity investments which are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\\u00a0(1) Allscripts share of the earnings of our equity method investees is reported based on a one quarter lag. During 2018, we acquired certain non-marketable equity securities of two third parties and entered into a commercial agreement with one of the third parties for total consideration of $11.7 million. During 2018, we also acquired a $1.8 million non-marketable convertible note of a third party. These investments are recorded in the Other asset caption within the consolidated balance sheets. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our equity investments primarily because of their illiquidity and restricted marketability as of December 31, 2019.

In assessing our short term and long term liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, capital expenditure and operating expense commitments, and required finance lease, interest and debt payments and other obligations. The following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows. Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities. Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, employees and interest payments made to our finance lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2019, 2018 and 2017 includes interest payments on our note obligations of $38.0 million, $32.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our primary use of investing cash is for purchases of property and equipment. These amounts were $47.0 million, $49.9 million and $45.8 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network. In 2019, 2018 and 2017 we obtained $11.3 million, $9.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of network equipment and software in non-cash exchanges for notes payable under an installment payment agreement. Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities. Our primary uses of cash for financing activities are for dividend payments, stock purchases and principal payments under our finance lease obligations. Amounts paid under our stock buyback program were $6.6 million for 2018 and $1.8 million for 2017. There were no stock purchases for 2019. During 2019, 2018 and 2017 we paid $112.6 million, $97.9 million and $81.7 million, respectively, for our quarterly dividend payments. Our quarterly dividend payments have increased due to regular quarterly increases in our quarterly dividend per share amounts. Principal payments under our finance lease obligations were $9.1 million, $10.3 million and $11.2 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are impacted by the timing and extent of our network expansion activities. Our financing activities also include proceeds from and repayments of our debt offerings. In June 2019 we received net proceeds of $152.1 million from the issuance of our \\u20ac135.0 million of 2024 Notes. In August 2018 we received net proceeds of $69.9 million from the issuance of our $70.0 million of senior secured notes.
